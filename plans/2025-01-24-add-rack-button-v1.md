# Add Rack Button Implementation Plan - COMPLETED

## Objective ‚úÖ
Add an "Add Rack" button beside the existing "Add Device" button in the ServerInventory component. The button will open a dialog with a rack name input field and Cancel/OK buttons. The functionality will be implemented later as briefed by the user.

## Implementation Status: COMPLETED

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Syntax Error in Import Statement** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed: `import { format } = from 'date-fns';` ‚Üí `import { format } from 'date-fns';`
   
2. **Duplicate canEdit Variable Definition** ‚úÖ
   - Removed duplicate definition of `const canEdit = hasRole('engineer');`

3. **Build Verification** ‚úÖ
   - Project now builds successfully without errors
   - Development server starts correctly

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features:
- Add Rack button appears beside Add Device button for users with engineer permissions
- Dialog opens with proper form fields (rack name input, Cancel/OK buttons)
- Form validation prevents empty rack names using Zod schema
- Dialog closes properly on Cancel and OK actions
- Form resets correctly when dialog is reopened
- No interference with existing Add Device functionality
- Consistent styling and behavior with existing UI patterns
- Role-based access control (engineer permissions required)

### üìù Current Functionality:
- The Add Rack button opens a dialog with rack name input
- Form validation ensures rack name is required
- On submission, displays a toast message with the rack name
- Logs the rack name to console for debugging
- Placeholder message indicates database functionality is pending

### üîÑ Pending (As Requested):
- Database integration for actually saving new racks
- Integration with existing rack dropdown in server form
- Real-time updates to rack selection options

## Verification Criteria - All Met ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Add Rack button appears beside Add Device button for users with engineer permissions
- ‚úÖ Dialog opens with proper form fields (rack name input, Cancel/OK buttons)
- ‚úÖ Form validation prevents empty rack names
- ‚úÖ Dialog closes properly on Cancel and OK actions
- ‚úÖ Form resets correctly when dialog is reopened
- ‚úÖ No interference with existing Add Device functionality
- ‚úÖ Consistent styling and behavior with existing UI patterns

## Technical Implementation Details

### Form Management ‚úÖ
- Uses separate react-hook-form instance for rack creation (`registerRack`, `handleRackSubmit`)
- Zod validation schema (`addRackSchema`) for rack name validation
- Proper error handling and display

### UI State Management ‚úÖ
- `isAddRackDialogOpen` state controls dialog visibility
- `canEdit` variable properly defined based on `hasRole('engineer')`
- Separate form state prevents conflicts with server form

### Role-Based Access Control ‚úÖ
- Only users with engineer role can see and use the Add Rack button
- Permission check in `onAddRackSubmit` function
- Consistent with existing Add Device permissions

### Dialog Structure ‚úÖ
- Uses shadcn/ui Dialog components
- Proper DialogHeader, DialogContent, and DialogFooter
- Form submission handling with proper event handling

## Ready for Next Phase
The Add Rack button is now fully functional and ready for the database integration functionality to be implemented as briefed later.
