# EditWidget Server Filtering Enhancement

## Objective
Implement comprehensive server filtering capabilities in the editWidget functionality, allowing users to configure widgets that display servers filtered by specific Model, Data Center (DC), Allocation, and Environment criteria. This enhancement will provide granular control over server data visualization in dashboard widgets.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analyze Current Widget Data Source Structure**
   - Dependencies: None
   - Notes: Examine current data source configuration in WidgetEditDialog to understand existing filter capabilities and identify extension points
   - Files: `src/components/dashboard/WidgetEditDialog.tsx:280`, `src/hooks/useDashboard.ts:35`, `src/hooks/useWidgetData.ts:6`
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Design Enhanced Filter Interface Schema**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Create new TypeScript interfaces for multi-criteria filtering, extending current QueryConfig and FilterConfig structures. Define filter logic types (AND/OR operations)
   - Files: `src/hooks/useDashboard.ts:47`, `src/types/filterTypes.ts` (new), extend existing Widget interface
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Extend Widget Configuration Data Model**
   - Dependencies: Task 2
   - Notes: Update Widget interface and database schema to support complex filter configurations. Ensure backward compatibility with existing widgets
   - Files: `src/hooks/useDashboard.ts:19`, database migration for enhanced filter storage
   - Status: Not Started

4. **Create Server Filter Component**
   - Dependencies: Task 2, Task 3
   - Notes: Build reusable component for server filtering with hierarchical dropdowns for Model, DC (Site/Building/Floor/Room), Allocation, and Environment. Include filter logic selection (AND/OR)
   - Files: `src/components/dashboard/ServerFilterComponent.tsx` (new), `src/components/ui/MultiSelectFilter.tsx` (new)
   - Status: Not Started

5. **Update WidgetEditDialog with Enhanced Filters**
   - Dependencies: Task 4
   - Notes: Integrate new filter component into existing dialog. Add conditional rendering based on selected table (servers). Maintain existing functionality for other tables
   - Files: `src/components/dashboard/WidgetEditDialog.tsx:280`
   - Status: Not Started

6. **Implement Filter Query Logic**
   - Dependencies: Task 3
   - Notes: Create query builders that handle multiple filter criteria with proper SQL generation. Implement hierarchical filtering for DC components and optimize query performance
   - Files: `src/hooks/useWidgetData.ts:6`, `src/lib/api/servers.ts:29`, `src/utils/queryBuilder.ts` (new)
   - Status: Not Started

7. **Update Widget Rendering Components**
   - Dependencies: Task 6
   - Notes: Ensure all widget types (chart, metric, timeline) can handle filtered data properly. Update data processing logic to respect filter configurations
   - Files: `src/components/dashboard/EnhancedChartWidget.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/SimpleMetricWidget.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/TimelineWidget.tsx`
   - Status: Not Started

8. **Add Filter Validation and Error Handling**
   - Dependencies: Task 5, Task 6
   - Notes: Implement validation for filter combinations, handle edge cases (no results, invalid combinations), and provide user feedback
   - Files: `src/utils/filterValidation.ts` (new), error boundary components, toast notifications
   - Status: Not Started

9. **Create Filter Persistence Layer**
   - Dependencies: Task 3
   - Notes: Implement saving/loading of filter configurations in widget settings. Ensure filters persist across dashboard sessions
   - Files: Database migration for filter storage, API endpoints for filter CRUD operations
   - Status: Not Started

10. **Update Dashboard State Management**
    - Dependencies: Task 7, Task 9
    - Notes: Ensure dashboard properly handles widget filter state changes, updates widget data when filters change, and maintains performance
    - Files: `src/hooks/useDashboard.ts`, `src/components/dashboard/CustomDashboard.tsx:184`
    - Status: Not Started

11. **Implement Filter Preview and Testing**
    - Dependencies: All previous tasks
    - Notes: Add filter preview functionality to show result counts before saving. Create comprehensive testing for filter functionality across all widget types
    - Files: Filter preview components, test utilities, integration tests
    - Status: Not Started

12. **Documentation and User Guide Updates**
    - Dependencies: Task 11
    - Notes: Update documentation to reflect new filtering capabilities, create user guides for filter configuration, and document API changes
    - Files: Documentation files, inline code comments, user guides
    - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria
- Widget edit dialog displays server-specific filtering options when "servers" table is selected
- Users can configure filters for Model, DC (Site/Building/Floor/Room), Allocation, and Environment
- Filters support both AND and OR logic operations
- Hierarchical DC filtering works correctly (selecting site filters available buildings, etc.)
- Widget data updates correctly when filter configurations change
- Filter configurations persist across dashboard sessions
- All widget types (chart, metric, timeline) respect filter configurations
- Performance remains acceptable with complex filter combinations
- Existing widgets without filters continue to work unchanged
- Filter validation prevents invalid configurations and provides helpful error messages

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Performance Degradation with Complex Filters**
   Mitigation: Implement query optimization, add database indexes for filter fields, implement result caching, and provide filter result count previews

2. **UI Complexity Overwhelming Users**
   Mitigation: Implement progressive disclosure (basic vs advanced filters), provide filter templates/presets, add contextual help, and conduct user testing

3. **Database Schema Changes Breaking Existing Functionality**
   Mitigation: Use additive schema changes only, implement comprehensive migration testing, maintain backward compatibility, and create rollback procedures

4. **Filter Logic Complexity Leading to Bugs**
   Mitigation: Implement comprehensive unit testing for filter logic, create integration tests for all filter combinations, add filter validation, and provide clear error messages

5. **State Management Complexity**
   Mitigation: Use established state management patterns, implement proper error boundaries, add state debugging tools, and ensure proper cleanup of filter state

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Simple Extension Approach**: Extend current basic filtering with additional dropdown fields for each filter criterion. Pros: Quick implementation, familiar UI. Cons: Limited flexibility, potential UI clutter.

2. **Advanced Query Builder Approach**: Implement a sophisticated query builder interface similar to database query tools. Pros: Maximum flexibility, powerful filtering. Cons: Complex implementation, steep learning curve.

3. **Hybrid Approach**: Provide both simple preset filters and advanced custom filter builder. Pros: Serves both basic and advanced users, scalable. Cons: More complex implementation, requires careful UX design.

4. **Template-Based Approach**: Create predefined filter templates for common use cases with option to customize. Pros: Easy to use, covers common scenarios. Cons: May not cover all edge cases, requires template maintenance.
